# This is a bundle of a few OpenGL test projects in C++ 

I decided to touch in a few computer graphics concepts
using OpenGL/GLSL (OpenGL shading language) to deep dive
into the core features and concepts of computer graphics.

the code here is meant to be a recap for me and feel free
to use it for studying, it touches the very basics of
window management, shading language, linear algebra, 
image processing and many more concepts... please be gentle lol!


## This repository uses:
1. C++ as the main Compiling language;
2. GLFW for window management;
3. GLM for mathematical equations and support;
4. SOIL2 for Image loading and saving;
5. CMake for faster compiling and linking;
